# Whim

Whim is a location-based social app designed to encourage in-person interaction and healthy relationships. Through location-based matching, the app connects you with people with similar interests, who frequent the same spots as you.

Whim leverages background geolocation to continuously scan for connections, even when the app is in the background. It features a warm, welcoming design, emphasizing human connection and spontaneity.
